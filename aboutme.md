My name is Martin Leitner-Ankerl, and I am a software developer currently working at [Dynatrace](https://www.dynatrace.com). This is my private blog and not in any way related to my employer.

I had my first exposure to software development at [HTL Hollabrunn](http://www.htl-hl.ac.at/), where I studied control engineering and discovered my passion for programming. In 1999, I began my professional career at [CSC Austria](http://at.country.csc.com/de/) (formerly ServoData) as a junior developer, where I was involved in developing banking software. While it was a solid and well-paying job, it did not satisfy my interests.

After working for a year, I decided to pursue my passion and enrolled in a Software Engineering program at [FH Upper Austria in Hagenberg](https://www.fh-ooe.at/en/hagenberg-campus/), which I highly recommend. During my studies, I had the opportunity to do my internship at [Industrial Research Limited](http://www.irl.cri.nz/) in Auckland, New Zealand. I returned to Austria to write my diploma thesis at [Joanneum Research](http://www.joanneum.at/de/index.php).

In 2004, I started working at [PROFACTOR](http://www.profactor.at) in the process and system intelligence department, with a focus on multi-agent systems. Since then, I have worked on multiple research projects with both universities and small and medium-sized enterprises as partners. Project work with both universities and enterprises is quite challenging because of the different interests and focus of the partners. We have to satisfy both worlds and deliver first-class research and high-quality software. To achieve this, I combine modern software engineering methods [agile software development](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development), [test-driven development](http://www.agiledata.org/essays/tdd.html), [extreme programming](http://www.extremeprogramming.org/), etc. with our research process.

In 2016, I joined [Dynatrace](https://www.dynatrace.com) as a native developer working on the monitoring solution [OneAgent](https://www.dynatrace.com/platform/oneagent/).

Apart from my job, I have developed several open-source tools in my free time and continue to contribute to open-source projects whenever I have the time. You can find most of my work on [GitHub/martinus](https://github.com/martinus/). You can contact me at `martin.ankerl@gmail.com`.
