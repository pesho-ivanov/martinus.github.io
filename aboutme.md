TODO this is not up to date.

My name is Martin Ankerl, I am a software developer, and work in the Multi-Agent Systems department at the research company [Profactor](http://www.profactor.at).

I had my first exposure to software development in a [college](http://www.htl-hl.ac.at/) for control engineering, and was hooked. In 1999 I began working at [CSC Austria](http://at.country.csc.com/de/) (formerly ServoData) as a Junior professional developer where I was involved in developing banking software. While it was a solid and well payed job, it did not satisfy my interests.

After working for a one year I quit and began studying [Software Engineering](http://webbler.fhs-hagenberg.ac.at/webbler.exe?database=SEP.MDB&getpagename=index) at the university [Hagenberg](http://www.fh-hagenberg.at/), which I can highly recommend. During my study I had the chance to do my internship at [Industrial Research Limited](http://www.irl.cri.nz/) in Auckland, New Zealand. I went back to Austria to write my diploma thesis at [Joanneum Research](http://www.joanneum.at/de/index.php).

In 2004 I started working at [Profactor](http://www.profactor.at) at the process and system intelligence department, with a focus on multi agent systems. Since then I have worked on multiple research projects with both universities and small and medium-sized enterprises as partners. Project work with both universities and enterprises is quite challenging because of the different interests and focus of the partners: we have to satisfy both worlds and deliver first class research in high quality software. To achieve this I am combining modern software engineering methods ([agile software development](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development), [test driven development](http://www.agiledata.org/essays/tdd.html), [extreme programming](http://www.extremeprogramming.org/), etc.) with our research process.

Apart from my job, I have developed several open source tools in my free time. The most prominent are [fxri](http://rubyforge.org/projects/fxri/) (an interface to the [Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) documentation. [fxri](http://rubyforge.org/projects/fxri/) is part of the [Ruby Windows Installer](http://rubyinstaller.rubyforge.org/wiki/wiki.pl)), [Yace](http://corewar.co.uk/ankerl/yace.htm) (a genetic programming tool), [XDCC-Fetch](http://xdccfetch.sourceforge.net/), and [several others](http://raa.ruby-lang.org/owner.rhtml?id=1550).
