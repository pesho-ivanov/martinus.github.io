My name is Martin Leitner-Ankerl, I am a software developer and currently work at [Dynatrace](https://www.dynatrace.com). This is my private block and not in any way related to my employee.

I had my first exposure to software development in a [college](http://www.htl-hl.ac.at/) for control engineering, and was hooked. In 1999 I began working at [CSC Austria](http://at.country.csc.com/de/) (formerly ServoData) as a Junior professional developer where I was involved in developing banking software. While it was a solid and well payed job, it did not satisfy my interests.

After working for a one year I quit and began studying [Software Engineering](https://www.fh-ooe.at/en/hagenberg-campus/) at the university Hagenberg, which I can highly recommend. During my study I had the chance to do my internship at [Industrial Research Limited](http://www.irl.cri.nz/) in Auckland, New Zealand. I went back to Austria to write my diploma thesis at [Joanneum Research](http://www.joanneum.at/de/index.php).

In 2004 I started working at [Profactor](http://www.profactor.at) at the process and system intelligence department, with a focus on multi agent systems. Since then I have worked on multiple research projects with both universities and small and medium-sized enterprises as partners. Project work with both universities and enterprises is quite challenging because of the different interests and focus of the partners: we have to satisfy both worlds and deliver first class research in high quality software. To achieve this I am combining modern software engineering methods ([agile software development](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development), [test driven development](http://www.agiledata.org/essays/tdd.html), [extreme programming](http://www.extremeprogramming.org/), etc.) with our research process.

In 2016 I started working at [Dynatrace](https://www.dynatrace.com) as a native developer on the monitoring solution [OneAgent](https://www.dynatrace.com/platform/oneagent/).

Apart from my job, I have developed several open source tools in my free time, and continue contributing to open source projects whenver I have the time. You can find most of my work on [github/martinus](https://github.com/martinus/). You can contact me at `martin.ankerl@gmail.com`.
