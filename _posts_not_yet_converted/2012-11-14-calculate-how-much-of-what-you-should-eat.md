I proudly present: the **[Keto Calculator](http://keto-calculator.ankerl.com/)**.





If you do not know about the ketogenic diet, [here are lots of introduction videos](http://j.mp/lchf).

This is a calculator that finds out the optimal nutrition ratio and amount of food you should eat for your weight loss / maintenance goal. It includes a nifty prognosis chart at the bottom, once you've filled out everything.

All of the formulas and calculations are based on the most up to date research I could find. I have discussed most of the calculations at length in the [/r/keto](http://reddit.com/r/keto) forum, where quite some scientific knowledgeable people hang out.

To the best of my knowledge, all the calculations are correct. Keep in mind that the data is based on the average person. Each individual is different, so the results might not be optimal for you.
