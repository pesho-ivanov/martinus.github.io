Over at [Lambda the Ultimate](http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/) there is a short [article](http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/node/view/1124) about how to teach programming. It links to a [very interesting presentation](http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/matthias/Presentations/FDPE2005/htdch.pdf) that talks about why students shoult be taught one semester of [functional programming](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming), and then [OOP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming). This seems to make a lot of sense, and makes me want to learn one of the very cool functional languages like [OCaml](http://caml.inria.fr/) or [Erlang](http://www.erlang.org/).
