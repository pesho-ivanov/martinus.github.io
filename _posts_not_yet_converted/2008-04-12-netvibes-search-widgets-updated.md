I have just updated the [Netvibes](http://www.netvibes.com/) ([iGoogle](http://www.google.com/ig), [Apple Dashboard](http://www.apple.com/downloads/dashboard/), [Opera](http://www.opera.com/), [Windows Live](http://www.live.com/)) search widgets with some Javascript voodoo. See [my previous post for more info](http://martin.ankerl.com/2008/03/18/netvibes-widgets-for-jdk-and-oss-search/) about these widgets. You can try them inline here:






Even though there is not much about this search, I have done quite a bit of user interface tweaks to make them easier to use. Here are the new features:



Remember Latest Selection

    When you use e.g. the [Open Source Search](http://eco.netvibes.com/widgets/234614/open-source-software-search), the previously used operating system (selected by clicking on the button) is automatically used when you just enter the search term end press Return. The selection is highlighted with bold text.


Select Text On Click

    Clicking into the text field automatically selects the whole text, so it is easier to reuse the textfield. I have also entered a default value, because from the webanalyzer logs I found out that many people just click on the buttons without entering any text, so now it should be more obvious how this thing works.


No Textfield Changes

    The previous version added a text like more:Linux into the search box that was used by the custom search. This clutter is now hidden from the user.


I think the widgets are much more useful now. If you like them, add them to [Netvibes](http://www.netvibes.com/), [iGoogle](http://www.google.com/ig), [Apple Dashboard](http://www.apple.com/downloads/dashboard/), [Opera](http://www.opera.com/), [Windows Live](http://www.live.com/), or Windows Vista here: 

  * [Open Source Software Search Widget](http://eco.netvibes.com/widgets/234614/open-source-software)


  * [Java Developer Kit Documentation Widget](http://eco.netvibes.com/widgets/234615/java-developer-kit-documentation)


I think the widgets are now much more useful. Post if you have any problems!
