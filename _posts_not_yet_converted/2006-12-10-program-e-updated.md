I have updated the extraction utility [e](http://martin.ankerl.com/2006/08/11/program-e-extract-any-archive/) with several new extraction rules. It now contain 28 different rules for extracting archives. This means it can extract zip, rar, 7zip, gzip, bzip2, rpm, deb, cab, arj, ace, ppmd, lzo, tar.bz2, tar.gz, tlz, tar.lzma, ar, cpio, dar, uharc, zzip, and some more with a single common interface if you have the tools on your PC. [Get it here](http://martin.ankerl.com/2006/08/11/program-e-extract-any-archive/).
