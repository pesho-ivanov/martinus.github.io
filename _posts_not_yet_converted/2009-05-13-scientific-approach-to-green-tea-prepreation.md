![](/img/2009/05/greentea.jpg)A few months ago I seem to have become a green tea advocat, since I have realized that it is probably [the most healthy beverage ever invented](http://www.whfoods.com/genpage.php?tname=foodspice&dbid=146) (including water).

The enormous study "[Green Tea Consumption and Mortality Due to Cardiovascular Disease, Cancer, and All Causes in Japan](http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/abstract/296/10/1255)" took 11 years with over 40.000 participants, and got the following result:

Green Tea Benefits in Woman



	
  * 23% lower risk of dying from any cause


	
  * 31% lower risk of dying from CVD


	
  * 62% lower risk of dying from stroke



Green Tea Benefits in Men

	
  * 12% lower risk of dying from any cause


	
  * 22% lower risk of dying from CVD


	
  * 42% lower risk of dying from stroke






On my quest for the perfect cup of tea, I have looked for scientific analysis and have found the enlightening paper "[Factors Affecting the Caffeine and Polyphenol Contents of Black and Green Tea Infusions](http://drmuthumani.googlepages.com/Factorsaffecting.pdf)". Here are the most important findings of it:

How to get the most out of a tea bag. The more extracted solids / catechins, the better.

**Brewing**



	
  * doubling the bags doubles the extracted solids (which is good!)


	
  * Increasing brewing time from 1 minute to 2 minutes doubles the catechins. 5 minutes tripple the catechins.



**Teabags vs. loose leafes**



	
  * Loose leafes are better than teabags.


	
  * When teabags are left floating, the flow resistance of the material blocks almost everything! this is very bad.


	
  * Continuously dunk a tea bag and the extraction is 4 times better!


	
  * Loose leafes are still about 20% better than dunked teabags, and after about 2 minutes the water is saturated (no need to wait any further)




**Leafe size / packing**



	
  * loose leafes? extraction is faster with smaller leafes. No need for dunking.


	
  * teabag with small leafes / tightly packed? Continuously dunk it


	
  * teabag with large leafes / loosely packed? Leafe it static (the flows are driven by convection)



**CONCLUSION**



	
  * loose leafes are the best. Brew for 2 minutes and you have everything they got.


	
  * If you have to use teabags, dunking the bag gets you 4 times the catechins!
