I was bored today so I have updated my little program Dice-RPG to work with fox 1.6.



# What?


Dice-RPG is a free dice throwing program that can be used for role playing games. Although I have never played a RPG in my entire life, my [brother](http://wyrm-chris.livejournal.com/) forced me to write this tool for the good of mankind (actually, I wrote it because I did not have anything better to do, but don't tell him).

Here is a screenshot:

# How?


To use Dice-RPG,




  1. Install the Ruby one-click installer from [here](http://www.ruby-lang.org/) if you don't have it already. This is a runtime, like Java or C#.

  2. Download [Dice-RPG.rbw](/files/dice-rpg.rbw) (right click and save the link) and doubleclick it.


Have fun!
