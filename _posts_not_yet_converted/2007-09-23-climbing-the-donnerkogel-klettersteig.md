I just came home from a fabulous _Klettersteig_ (I don't know an English name for this, maybe "fixed rope route"), namely the [Donnerkogel](http://www.bergsteigen.at/de/touren.aspx?ID=123). This was a fabulous day, excellent weather, and we had a lot of fun. Here are some impressions:



# Donnermandl


Start of the last stage of the fixed rope route, the "[Donnermandl](http://horalka.igoto.eu/photo.php?id=october_10&a=dachstein&t=2005-10)", at 1920m height. This has difficulty [C/D](http://www.bergnews.com/service/klettersteig-schwierigkeitsgrade.htm) and is very exposed, but you are rewarded with fabulous views!

# Donnerkogel Top


We reached the top, yay! The Big Donnerkogel has 2045m, and even though it is September already it was very warm.

# Dachstein


Behind me (left guy) is the famous [Dachstein,](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoher_Dachstein) one of the most often photographed mountain from Austria.

# Enjoy the View


It is beautiful on the top, it really is. You can sit there for hours and just watch and listen to nature.

This was one of my rare non-technical postings. Hope you enjoyed it!
