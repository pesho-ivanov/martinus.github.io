[Eclipse](http://www.eclipse.org/) has lots and lots of hotkeys, but for daily work you need only a small subset. This are the hotkeys I consider to be the most important time savers:
<!-- more -->


## Moving around






  * **Ctrl+J** -- Incremental Search


  * **Ctrl+Shift+T** -- Search a type, with search on typing. You can use only the upcase letters (e.g. type "MIL" to find MouseInputListener)


  * **Ctrl+F6** -- Switch between last used files


  * **F3** -- Open declaration


  * **Ctrl+Alt+H** -- Open Call Hierarchy





## Editing






  * **Ctrl+1** -- Quick Fix: press while cursor is positioned at member variable, parameter, selection, warnings, errors, ...


  * **Ctrl+Space** -- Context Assist: press after a ., or to use macros (for, while, sysout, ...). Press in class-scope to automatically create method declarations.


  * **Ctrl+Shift+O** -- Organize Imports


  * **Ctrl+Shift+F** -- Reformat source


  * **Alt+Shift+T** -- Show Refactor Quick Menu



In case these hotkeys are not enough or you have forgotten which hotkey does what, you can always press **Ctrl+Shift+L** to get a nice list of all the hotkeys.
