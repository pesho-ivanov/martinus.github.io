On my quest of successfully installing a wiki at my workplace, I came to the conclusion that the biggest problem is a social one. On this quest, I fought with [Google](http://www.google.com) [and](http://www.alltheweb.com/) [other](http://beta.previewseek.com/) [search](http://www.teoma.com/) [engines](http://vivisimo.com/) to present you this list of great links to this topic:


* [Getting Your Wiki Adpoted](http://www.possibility.com/epowiki/Wiki.jsp?page=GettingYourWikiAdopted)
* [It's On The Wiki!](http://www.tmtm.com/nothing/archives/001974.html)
* [HOWTO Install TWiki as a Corporate Intranet](http://servers.linux.com/article.pl?sid=02/09/18/1449248&tid=87&tid=100&tid=51&tid=42) (Start reading at "Getting Buy-in")
* [Introducing a Wiki into an organization: the QuickDate page](http://pascal.vanhecke.info/2005/09/04/introducing-a-wiki-into-an-organization-the-quickdate-page/)

There does not seem to be much information on this topic available, but it is something to start with.
