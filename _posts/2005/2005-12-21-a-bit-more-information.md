I have worked on [several open source projects](http://raa.ruby-lang.org/owner.rhtml?id=1550).  

I am also the creator of [Yace](http://www.pvk.ca/tiki/tiki-index.php?page=Evolving) (genetic programming of assembler like code, and [exhaust-ma](http://www.freshports.org/games/exhaust-ma) (which was the fastest interpreter for [Redcode](http://vyznev.net/corewar/guide.html) for a long time). In former times I made myself busy with C++, fairly low level optimization, template metaprogramming, etc. but right now I feel more at home with modern software engineering technologies.
