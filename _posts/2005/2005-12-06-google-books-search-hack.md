[Googles book search](http://books.google.com/) does not allow browsing all the pages of books. My first try to go around this was to search a book for words like and which should be available on most pages. Google does not allow this, but have a look at the following funny search term:

```
of|on
```

This should display all pages that contain the words of or on. Google does not search for either of the two words because they are too general, but strangely returns _ALL_ the pages.

So, there you go. All pages browsable.

## Update 2005-12-07:

It looks like Google has quickly fixed the problem, when browsing a few pages you get the error message

> Your search is too general. Please try again with a more specific query.
