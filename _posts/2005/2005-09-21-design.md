Please tell me what you think about the design of this site. Is it hard to read? This is a test posting to demonstrate how all the formatting looks like. This is **bold**, and this is _italic_. A link [looks like this](http://google.com), and now to a blockquote:

> There is a theory which states that if ever anybody discovers exactly what the Universe is for and why it is here, it will instantly disappear and be replaced by something even more bizarre and inexplicable. There is another theory which states that this has already happened.  
> - Douglas Adams

Now, this is how ~~removed text~~ looks like. Now what about smilies, are they automatically replaced? :smiley: and here are some more: :wink: :worried: :D

This is how a bullet list looks like:

  * First item,
  * second item,
  * third item.

An ordered list:
	
  1. First item,	
  1. second item,
  1. third item.

Now to some code: `#define void int` That's it. This is how a very long pre formatted text looks like, that does not fit the screen:

```css
small, #sidebar ul ul li, #sidebar ul ol li, .nocomments, .postmetadata, blockquote, pre, strike {
```

A line separator:

* * *

1. Item one, with teletype stuff in it.
```
preformatted stuff
```
1. Another item

done!
