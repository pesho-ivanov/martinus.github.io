Subversion has the ability to output a log file in XML format. I think it would be pretty straightforward to implement an application in Ruby (mabe with use of [Amrita](http://amrita.sourceforge.jp/)), that creates some nice looking statistic about the repository. 


	

On a side note, I have a personal subversion repository that contains everything I have accomplished during my study of [Software Engineering](http://se.fh-hagenberg.at/webbler.exe?database=SE.MDB&getpagename=WasIst) in [Hagenberg](http://www.fh-hagenberg.at/). This dates back to somewhere in 2000, and so far I am at revision 3628, and the repository uses about 500MB. It is a bit strange that 5 years worth of work can fit on a single CD 8-)
