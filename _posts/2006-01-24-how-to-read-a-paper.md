Some time ago there was a question on [Lambda the Ultimate](http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/) that asked [how people read papers](http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/node/794).


My problem is to quickly select the most promissing papers from the gazillions that are available. So, this is how I do it:

1. Read the title

1. Quickly skim the abstract - get an overview what it is all about

1. Read the conclusion - find out what the paper really wants to tell you

1. Really read the abstract - find out how the paper comes to the conclusion

1. Read TOC - find out which chapters are worth reading

1. Read the chapters that are worth reading.

After each step I decide if it is worth to spend more time on it or to move on to other papers.
