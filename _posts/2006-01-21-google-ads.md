I have just added Google ads to try to compensate a bit of my hosting costs. I have tried to make it as unobstrusive as possible, so it should not annoy. In case it does annoy you, you might want to give [Adblock](http://adblock.mozdev.org/) and the automatic [Adblock Filterset.G Updater](http://www.pierceive.com/) a try.


## Update

I know this site looks like it should be in all browsers except in Internet Explorer. I am trying to fix this, in the meantime please switch to a better browser like [Firefox](http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/) or [Opera](http://www.opera.com/).

## Update 2 

No more ads. they are just too ugly, and traffic is not that large.

## Update 3 

Ads now look ok, and the site looks also good if you use an adblocker. I now get filthy rich from my ad revenue of $0.19 per day, wohoo!
