I have just found out that somebody has translated my [textanalyzer](/2007/01/09/textanalyzer-automatically-extract-characteristic-words/) from Ruby into Python. It also contains some improvements like stopwords. The core algorithm is still the same. Get it at [kelpheavyweaponry.com](http://www.kelpheavyweaponry.com/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/trunk/libraries/textanalyze.py).
