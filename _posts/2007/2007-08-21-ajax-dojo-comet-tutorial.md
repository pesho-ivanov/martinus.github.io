**EDIT**: This tutorial is for an old version of dojo / comet, and it will not work in a recent version!

Markus Holzmann, an intern at [Profactor](http://www.profactor.at/) of my fellow colleague [Philipp Hartl](http://leanaustria.net/), had the opportunity to experiment with [Ajax](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajax_(programming)) during his job. He wrote a tutorial about how to push events from the server to the client. For example, display popup messages on all browsers at the same time (see screencast in [full resolution here](/files/2007/08/hello_comet.html)).

Read on how Markus did this:

## Cometd Hello World

I've read Chris Bucchere's [Say Hello World to Comet](http://thebdgway.blogspot.com/2006/11/say-hello-world-to-comet.html) and built an application based on this using a more current version of [Jetty](http://www.mortbay.org/) (version [6.1.5](http://dist.codehaus.org/jetty/jetty-6.1.5/)) which I embedded into a [Tomcat](http://tomcat.apache.org/) v5.5 Server. For the developing I used [Eclipse](http://www.eclipse.org/) 3.2.


## Start your Engines

At first you have to get the server running. As I mentioned I embedded Jetty into a Tomcat server. Therefore you have configure the libraries:

1. Add the packages `org.mortbay.cometd` and `dojox.cometd` to your source folder and delete the client package in the org.mortbay.cometd package.
1. Add `jetty-util-6.1.5.jar`, `jetty-6.1.5.jar` and `servlet-api-2.5-6.1.5.jar` to your build path.
1. Copy the `jetty-util-6.1.5.jar` file into the `/lib` folder in the `WEB-INF` directory.

Replace the existing servlets in your `web.xml` - file in the `WEB-INF` - folder with the following servlets:

```xml
<servlet>
  <servlet-name>cometd</servlet-name>
  <servlet-class>org.mortbay.cometd.continuation.ContinuationCometdServlet</servlet-class>
  <load-on-startup>1</load-on-startup>
</servlet>
<servlet-mapping>
  <servlet-name>cometd</servlet-name>
  <url-pattern>/cometd/*</url-pattern>
</servlet-mapping>
```

For the project I used the [dojo toolkit](http://dojotoolkit.org/) (version 0.4.3) which has an integrated [COMETd](http://www.cometd.com/) class that makes it easy to build comet projects. [Download it](http://download.dojotoolkit.org/release-0.4.3/dojo-0.4.3-ajax.tar.gz) and add it to your `WebContent` folder.

When you've done all this, the hardest piece of work for this program is already done.

## Hack the Code

Now you can implement the code for the client side: You need a HTML file with a button on it. The code for this looks like this ([download](/files/2007/08/hello_comet_test.html)):

```html
<html>
  <head>
    <script src="../dojo.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
    <script type="text/javascript">
      dojo.require("dojo.io.cometd");
      cometd.init({}, "cometd");
      cometd.subscribe("/hello/world", false, "publishHandler");
      publishHandler = function(msg) {
        alert(msg.data.test);
      }
    </script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <input type="button" value="Click Me!" onclick="<b>cometd.publish('/hello/world', { test: 'hello world' } )</b>">
  </body>
</html>
```

Line by line, the above bold code works like this:


1. In this line you integrate the dojo toolkit into the project:
   ```html
   <script src="../dojo.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
   ```

1. To activate the cometd class of dojo: 
   ```javascript
   dojo.require("dojo.io.cometd");
   ```

1. Connect the server with the client: 
   ```javascript
   cometd.init({}, "cometd");
   ```

1. Here we say what to do when there is a subscribe event: 
   ```javascript    
   cometd.subscribe("/hello/world", false, "publishHandler");
   ```

1. Last but not least, the publishHandler function serves as the callback function, which uses alert to show a simple message box: 
   ```javascript    
   publishHandler = function(msg) {
     alert(msg.data.test);
   }
   ```

## Give it a Try


When you load the HTML file now, you can click on the button and an alert box saying _hello world_ will appear:


![Hello World](/img/2007/08/helloworld.png)


The reason for this is that when you click the code 
    
```javascript
cometd.publish('/hello/world', { test: 'hello world' } )
```

is executed which publishes a text on the channel with the id `/hello/world`.

The funny thing is that this is able to run on any number of browsers. Everytime when a client clicks the button, on _all_ browsers that view this page the alert box is shown. (See screencast above).


## Pushing Data from Server to Client

You can also add serverside code to trigger an event. I wrote a JSP file with the following code:

```javascript   
<%@page import="java.util.*"%>
<%@page import="dojox.cometd.*" %>
<%
Bayeux b = (Bayeux)getServletContext().getAttribute(Bayeux.DOJOX_COMETD_BAYEUX);
Channel c = b.getChannel("/hello/world",false);

Map<string,object> message = new HashMap<string,object>();
message.put("test", "jsp: hello world");

c.publish(b.newClient("server_user",null),message, "new server message");
%>
```

When this page is loaded, an alert popup appears at the page saying _jsp: hello world_.

That's it. Happy hacking!
