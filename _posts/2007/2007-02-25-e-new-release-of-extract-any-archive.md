Extract Any Archive just got better: When you extract multiple archives at once, e.g. with

```bash
e *.rar
```

and some files are not extractable, e continuous to extract the other files and prints an error message with all the failed files when it has finished. More info and download of e is [here](/2006/08/11/program-e-extract-any-archive/).
