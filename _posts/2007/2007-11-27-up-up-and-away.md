This will be my last entry for some time. On 1st December I fly to [South Africa](http://www.southafrica.net/) and will have lots of fun traveling around, learning [how to surf](http://euroross.blogspot.com/Wipeout.jpg), and generally doing all kinds of [stupid things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1FivamFXms) for about 3 weeks. After that I will celebrate Christmas with my family and eat Christmas cookies until I cannot move anymore. To get fit again, I have already book my flight to [Barcelona](http://www.barcelona.com/) where there is a great [Aikido](http://aikidoschule.at/was-ist-aikido/) class. After celebrating New Year there and eating tons of [Tapas](http://www.wholefoodsmarket.com/recipes/kitchentips/tapas.html) I finally get back on 3rd January.

Long story short, don't expect any response from me until the 4th January.

## UPDATE
I am back, and still alive. Yay! :smiley:
