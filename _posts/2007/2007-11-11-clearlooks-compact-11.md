The [Clearlooks Compact](/2007/11/04/clearlooks-compact-gnome-theme/) theme was released just a few days ago, and it already is the [highest rated theme](http://www.gnome-look.org/index.php?xcontentmode=100) at [gnome-look.org](http://gnome-look.org/), out of more than a thousand. I guess the compactness really hit the nerve of lots of Linux users.

This encouraged me to do some further updates, I have incorporated lots of several tips and from the post "[Making Eclipse look good on Linux](http://blog.xam.dk/archives/81-Making-Eclipse-look-good-on-Linux.html)". The result is a very compact theme that does not waste space if possible.


* Get Clearlooks Compact [here](/2007/11/04/clearlooks-compact-gnome-theme/).
* Vote [here](http://www.gnome-look.org/content/show.php/Clearlooks+Compact?content=69357) if you think its good or bad.

Hope you like it as much as I do :smiley:
