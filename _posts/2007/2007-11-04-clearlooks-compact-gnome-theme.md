I have been using [Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com/) for quite a while now, but one thing I really dislike is that all the themes are huge space wasters compared to Windows XP. This finally got me angry enough to create a customized version of the [Clearlooks](http://clearlooks.sourceforge.net/) theme that tries to be very compact but still maintain its beautiful look. I like the result quite a lot, I have been using this theme for more than two weeks now and it works great. It is especially nice for intense applications like [Eclipse](http://www.eclipse.org).

**UPDATE**: [Human Compact Theme for Ubuntu 8.10 (Intrepid Ibex)](/2008/11/04/human-compact-themes-for-ubuntu-810/) is available!


## Comparison

Move your mouse over the image to see how the dialog looks like with clearlooks-compact. The buttons and spacing are smaller, which results in much more visible space for the actual content.


<style type="text/css">
<!--
#clearlooks a {
    display:block;
    background-image:url(/img/2007/11/clearlooks.png);
    width:435px;
    height:421px;
}
#clearlooks a:hover {
    background-image:url(/img/2007/11/clearlooks-compact.png);
}
-->
</style>

<center>
    <div id="clearlooks">
        <a href="#">&nbsp;</a>
    </div>
</center>


## More Screenshots

Here are some more screenshots that I have taken with Clearlooks Compact enabled. Especially the Eclipse shot is great, there the theme really shines. It is even more compact than the Windows XP look.

If you are curious, I have used [Tahoma](http://www.google.at/search?q=tahoma+ttf), size 9 for the application font, and the [MiscFixed](https://www.google.com/search?q=miscfixed++ttf) for the sourcecode.


## Download & Installation

Installation is extremely simple, in Ubuntu 7.10 (Gutsy Gibbon) you can do it this way:


1. Click System > Preferences > Appearance.
1. Drag & drop the link [ClearlooksCompact-1.5.tar.bz2](/files/2007/11/ClearlooksCompact-1.5.tar.bz2) into the *Appearence* window.

Beware that this is just definition of the Clearlooks control spacings. That means you have to have the clearlooks engine installed (which you most likely have, it is the default theme of Ubuntu). To change back, click on the currently active Theme, choose "Customize", and select other controls instead of "Clearlooks Compact".
