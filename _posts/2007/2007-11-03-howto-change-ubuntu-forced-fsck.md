In Ubuntu 7.10 the boot hard disk is checked every 20 boots. I have to boot my laptop quite often, so about once a week booting takes more than 10 minutes. This clearly sucks. Fortunately, there is an easy way to fix this. With `tune2fs` it is possible to change the interval from mount-times to timed interval:

```bash
sudo tune2fs -c 0 -i 1m /dev/sda3
```

This disables maximum mount time for forced check, but instead uses timed check. Every month the harddisk is forced to get checked. I can live with that.
