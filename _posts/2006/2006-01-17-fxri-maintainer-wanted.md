### Update:

Now that was quick. Thanks to [Markus Prinz ](http://raging.crack-monkey.net/) for taking over maintenance!

### Original Message

I am the creator of [fxri](http://rubyforge.org/projects/fxri/), which is an [FXRuby](http://www.fxruby.org/) interface to RI, that supports search-on-typing. Fxri is a small little program, that tries to provide the desired information as fast as possible.

I currently do not have time to do any Ruby related work, so I would be very happy if somebody could take over the maintenance of this little tool. I do not expect it to be much work, maybe a little adaption to new releases of FXRuby from time to time, and creating new gems to download.

So, if anyone is interested and has an account on [rubyforge.org](http://rubyforge.org), please [contact me](mailto:martin.ankerl@gmail.com) and I will give you administrator access.

And fear not, i think [the code](http://rubyforge.org/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/fxri/fxri/?root=fxri) is not so bad. At least I have some comments in it :wink:
