Some time ago I have written a [Subversion Guideline](/files/2006/01/SubversionGuideline.pdf). Contrary to the usual [subversion](http://subversion.tigris.org/) information found on the web, I have tried to describe the subversion policies used in a project I work in as compact as possible. The result is now a 1 page description that can be nicely printed and pinned right next to the monitor.

Get it here, in different formats:
	
  * [Subversion Guideline PDF](/files/2006/01/SubversionGuideline.pdf)
  * [Subversion Guideline Word Document (Original)](/files/2006/01/SubversionGuideline.doc)

It is very likely that this guideline does not fit your exact need, you have to modify it to the development environment you want to apply it to. But it should be a good start.
