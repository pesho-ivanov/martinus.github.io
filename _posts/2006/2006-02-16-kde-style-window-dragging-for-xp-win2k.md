Thanks to the very cool but rather unknown [AutoHotkey](http://www.autohotkey.com/) application, I have wrapped an already available [KDE style](http://www.autohotkey.com/docs/scripts/EasyWindowDrag_(KDE).htm) script into a small executable plus a KDE icon. The only problem is that you can get so used to it that you can't use a computer without it any more.

Download the executable, start it, and off you go.
	
*[kde-mouse.exe](/files/2006/02/kde-mouse.zip)* (190 kb)
	
The features are:

  * **Alt + Left Button**: Drag to move a window.	
  * **Alt + Right Button**: Drag to resize a window.
  * **Double-Alt + Left Button**: Minimize a window.
  * **Double-Alt + Right Button**: Maximize/Restore a window.
  * **Double-Alt + Middle Button**: Close a window.

Happy draging!
