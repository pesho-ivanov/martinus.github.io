Some years ago I have played a bit with [CoreWars](http://www.corewars.org/), which is a very interesting programming game. corwars.co.uk seems is now hosting my site, because I am too lazy to integrate the data into my new homepage. Have a look at Yace, exhaust-ma and qMars [here](http://corewar.co.uk/ankerl/index.htm).
