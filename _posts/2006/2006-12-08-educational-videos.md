It is cold and foggy outside, which is the best time to kill... time. And what would be better than killing time with something extremely interesting? I have watched a lot of online documentations, and selected the cream of the crop for you. Watch all of them them, I ensure you that you will get this amazing "wow" feeling after each of them. Read on to view the videos.

## Should Google Go Nuclear? Clean, cheap, nuclear power (no, really)


Very knowledgeable professor [Robert W. Bussard](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_W._Bussard) talks about his findings on nuclear fusion which were just recently (November 2006) allowed to be made public. His lab really seems to be on to something big. He also voices big problems in the American research system.

## Human Computation

Lots of problems are still very hard to do with the computers, while humans can do them easily. Luis von Ahn gives an entertaining presentation on how to utilize this human power. Best of all, he shows how he can get the people to solve theses problems for free. Or even make them _pay_ for solving your problem. [Google is already using this technique](http://images.google.com/imagelabeler/), and there are some other games like [Peekaboom](http://www.peekaboom.org/).

## Why We Fight

War means big business. This BBC documentation provides an inside look at the anatomy of the American war machine. A must see. It starts with the powerfull farewell speech of [Eisenhower](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwight_D._Eisenhower#Retirement_and_death).

## The Elegant Universe

The world is very stranger place, so strange that it's weirdness seems impossible to understand. This video of 3 parts gives an excellent introduction into the [String Theory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_theory), which currently looks like it can give the deepest understanding of the universe we ever had.

If you like these videos you should have a look at the book [The Elegant Universe](http://www2.wwnorton.com/catalog/fall03/005858.htm). I have read half through it already, it is a bit more difficult to understand than the videos, but much more in depth and very well written.

## Vivek -- Homeless Prophet

Vivek is a homeless who really has something to say about life, the universe, and everything. Just ignore the pseudo funny comments of the people who record this.

## The Great Dictator -- Speech

Charlie Chaplin's holds a [speech](http://www.americanrhetoric.com/MovieSpeeches/moviespeechthegreatdictator.html) to the world in his satire "[The Great Dictator](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_Dictator#Making_of_the_film)". This movie was done in 1940 and the speech is still as relevant as if it was held yesterday.
