Finally, the homepage is online again (more or less). My last webhoster went bancrupt or something, at least he is unreachable. That means that our family's domain ankerl.org seems to be lost, along with all the files I had on the server.

I am slowly reconstructing and updating the homepage to bring it back into a working state. Sorry for the inconvenience.

## Update

I have almost everything up again, except for

* The old domain [ankerl.org](http://ankerl.org) is no more. I am using [ankerl.com](http://ankerl.com) now.
* I have lost my old style and have to painfully search and configure a better one.
* I have lost two images, e.g. the file `ondemand.jpg` from the post "How to make Firefox 40% faster".
* Some comments and one article about closures in java is lost forever.
