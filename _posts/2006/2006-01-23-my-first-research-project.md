I have recently met a really old friend of mine, with whom I have done quite a lot crazy things like building a professional bow and then hunting rabbits, abseiling from a bridge, diving, building remote controlled bombs, etc. (yes we were young and stupid, but it was great and I do not miss a second of this :smiley:

One of our most advanced projects and what I consider my first research project ever, was an electric driven bicycle that was equiped with a windscreen whiper motor and severy rechargeable buggy batteries:

This picture was taken in summer 1994, my friend Bernhard to the left, and me on the right. Believe me, it worked. Not only that, it totally rocked :smiley:
