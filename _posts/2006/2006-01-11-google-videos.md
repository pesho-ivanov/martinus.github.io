I believe Google has a new killer product, namely the [videos](http://video.google.com/). I do not have a TV, and am really looking forward to beeing able to watch the series I want to, whenever I want; and I even don't mind paying a litte fee for that.

Also, being able to integrate the videos into a homepage is an exceptional cool feature. For example, here is a cool presentation of the [100$ Laptop](http://laptop.media.mit.edu/) that will go into production in 2006:   

So long, and thanks for all the fish.

Oh my, the video does not work any more. History happens, now there is youtube and I am paying for Netflix.
