I recently upgraded from my 8 year old Kindle Keyboard (2011) to a brand new Kindle Paperwhite (2019, generation 10). So far, it is a great upgrade. Here are some tricks that I found useful:

## Custom Fonts
Connect the kindle with USB, you'll see a folder `fonts`. I've tried a few fonts, and really like [Literata](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Literata). It's very similar to Amazon's Bookerly, and made for e-books.

It's also the font you'll see in the header for this post. Here's how to install it:

1. Go to [https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Literata](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Literata)
2. Click "Select this font"
3. Click on the new popup
4. Click the download arrow to the right.
5. Extract and copy *all* `.ttf` fonts into the `fonts` folder. Copying just Literata-Regular is not enough because then the italic fonts don't look as good as they could be.  The "VariableFont" are not needed.

I've added a few custom themes:

* **Small**: Literata, size 1, small line distance, align left
* **Normal**: Literata, size 4.
* **Big**: Literata, bold 1, size 5.

## Calibre

[Calibre](https://calibre-ebook.com/) is a fantastic e-book manager. I've used it with a huge collection in both Windows and Linux. Most importantly, it can convert & send e-books to your kindle via the kindle-email address. Lots of good tips are [in this reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/kindle/comments/3b7dzl/tutorial_how_to_use_calibre_to_manage_book/).

* **Embed your favorite font**: Some books don't allow non-amazon fonts. Configure calibre to embed your favorite font to get around this: Choose "Common Options", "Look & Feel", set "Embed font family" to your preferred font. I use [Literata](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Literata).

## Clutter-Free Home Screen

Go to "Settings", "Device Options", "Advanced Options", disable "Home Screen View".

## Books, Books, Books

* There is [Amazon.com Prime Reading](https://amazon.com/primereading) (also e.g. [Amazon.de Prime Reading](https://amazon.de/primereading)). This is different from *Kindle Unlimited*, it's included in prime.
* [Project Gutenberg](http://www.gutenberg.org/browse/scores/top) as a top-list.
* I've heard rumors that it's possible to use IRC to download ebooks. There might even be some torrents with collection of IRC ebooks.
* Google search trick, add a book title to this query: <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=intitle%3D%22index+of%22+(mobi|epub)">intitle:"index of" (mobi\|epub)</a>

## Battery

Switch to Airplane mode, turn off brightness, turn off Page Refresh.
