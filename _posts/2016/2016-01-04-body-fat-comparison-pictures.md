Here is a collection of visual body fat charts. Use these to estimate your personal body fat for the [keto calculator](http://keto-calculator.ankerl.com/). See below for men.


## Women

As you can see, even the same body fat percentag (here twice 15%) can look quite different, depending on your muscles and where the body fat is positioned. The minimum possible body fat percentage is 8-9%. This low is not sustainable, and very unhealthy! If you are female, don't go that low.

## Men

As above with the female pictures, here are also two images with the same body fat percentage: 10% can look quite different, depending on how muscular you are and where your body fat is positioned. The lowest male can go os 3-4%, but this is not at all healthy at all. It is only possible to reach such low body fat for a very short period of time. I'd say the lowest you should go to still be healthy is 10%.


## Back to the Keto Calculator

Now when you have made up your mind where about your body fat percentage might be, head back to the [keto calculator](https://keto-calculator.ankerl.com/) and enter your number.
