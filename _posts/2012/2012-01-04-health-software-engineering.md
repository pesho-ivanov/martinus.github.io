One of my main interest apart from software development is health, mainly nutrition but also exercise. I will try to systematically collect my findings and write a health related blog post from time to time.

Keep in mind that I usually have no idea what I am talking about, I have not any medical background. I just try to collect and organize evidence that I am finding.

So, from now on expect some posts about stuff that might make you healthy, lose weight, gain weight, live longer, or die instantly ;)
