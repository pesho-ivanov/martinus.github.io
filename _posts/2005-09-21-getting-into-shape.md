The blog is finally getting into shape. I did some hefty modifications on the [White as Milk](http://www.azeemazeez.com/stuff/themes/) theme (at least it was difficult for me as I have not done anything in CSS for years). But now it looks nice at least in Firefox and Opera, I will test IE tomorror at work. Now it's time for me to put some content on the site.
