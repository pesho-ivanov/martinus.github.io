I have just created my first Android app. It is a simple game, called _Single N-Back_. It has been shown in multiple studies that this game can improve your [fluid intelligence](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid_and_crystallized_intelligence). 

You can get it here:

* Or just scan this QR code:

## Game Rules

The game rules are very simple:
You are shown a sequence of numbers and your task is to click the button if you see the current number matches the one from N steps earlier in the sequence. 

For example, in 2-Back, when you get the sequence

> 5, 3, 0, 4, 2, 8, **9**, 1, **9**

You should press the button because the currently showen numer 9 is the same as the number shown 2 steps back.

You start with 2-Back, and if more than 80% is correct, you can unlock the next N-back level.

## Screenshot

Here are some screenshots of the extremely ~~ugly~~ clean user interface:

## References

Since I have not made this test up by myself, here are some papers that explain the validity that that kind of game actually improves fluid intelligence:

Have fun!
