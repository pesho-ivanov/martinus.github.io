Today I have read about the [Instagram Engineering Challenge: The Unshredder](http://instagram-engineering.tumblr.com/post/12651721845/instagram-engineering-challenge-the-unshredder), and decided to give it a try. The task is simple to explain: Create a program that can unshred this image (do not try the challenge on this image, try the [original PNG source](http://instagram-static.s3.amazonaws.com/images/TokyoPanoramaShredded.png) instead!):

I have [postet here](http://derstandard.at/plink/1319182777697?sap=2&_pid=23674915#pid23674915) that I think I can solve it in 2 hours, and got some downvotes for that; so I have decided to really give it a try. Long story short, it took me about 2 hours and 35 minutes. I'm sure others can do it much faster too.

Before I started developing, I made some quick assumptions to simplify things:

* I want to code it in Ruby, this is the language where I am most productive.
* I can assume the size of the stripes is well known, and I have hardcoded this size.
* The image can be converted to RAW with an external tool, and written into RAW.

While coding I timed myself, and created a little timeline of my trials and errors. Since I wanted to finish as quickly as possible, the code is very ugly: no tests, some hardcoded constants, etc.

## Timeline

I coded this with a stopwatch, and created a timeline of my what has happened every few minute:

* `0:08` - how to read binary files...
* `0:14` - index RGB values
* `0:21` - difference calculation seems to privide a reasonable number
* `0:25` - create all pairings of each row (too slow: need to use logic for all slices)
* `0:30` - create all pairings
* `0:31` - sorted pairings
* `0:35` - copy and number image to mspaint to verify
* `0:36` - bugfix, wrong slice row calculation
* `0:48` - getting stuck with combining pairs
* `1:03` - recombining
* `1:14` - thinking about how to ensure not to combine invalid groups (duplicates!)
* `1:33` - got first reasonable order. Hopefully the correct order!!
* `1:47` - wrote first image, wrong order
* `1:53` - got an almost correct image! one slice was aligned wrong.
* `1:58` - no luck with grayscale
* `2:28` - damn black-white skyscraper!
* `2:29` - SUCCESSSS!!!!!!

Time not measured: I thought about the problem about 5 minutes before starting hacking. So my time is probably about 2:34.


## Code

Without further ado, I give you the code:
    
```ruby
class Img
  attr_reader :w, :h, :slices
  def initialize
    # unpack as 8bit unsigned chars
    @d = IO.binread("TokyoPanoramaShredded.raw").unpack("C*")
    @w = 640
    @h = 359
    @slices = 20
    @sw = @w / @slices
  end
  
  def write(sorted)
    data = @d.dup
    source_slice = 0
    sorted.each do |target_slice|
      # copy one slice
      @sw.times do |w|
        @h.times do |h|
          target_idx = idx(w + @sw * source_slice, h)
          source_idx = idx(w + @sw * target_slice, h)
          data[target_idx] = @d[source_idx]
          data[target_idx+1] = @d[source_idx+1]
          data[target_idx+2] = @d[source_idx+2]
        end
      end
      source_slice += 1
    end
    
    File.open("out.raw", "wb") do |f|
      f.write data.pack("C*")
    end
  end

  def idx(x, y)
    (y * @w + x) * 3
  end
  
  # top left is 0, 0
  def rgb(x, y)
    i = idx(x, y)    
    [@d[i], @d[i+1], @d[i+2]]
  end  
  
  # calculate sum of difference between r, g, b of two columns
  def difference(x1, x2)
    diff = 0
    @h.times do |y|    
      # find best in range. This is required because otherwise the black syscraper fucks things up.
      lower = y - 15
      lower = 0 if (lower < 0)
      
      upper = y + 15
      upper = @h-1 if upper >= @h
      
      best = 1e100
      lower.upto(upper) do |r|
        v = 0
        rgb1 = rgb(x1, r)
        rgb2 = rgb(x2, r)
        
        d = rgb1[0] - rgb2[0]
        v += d*d
        d = rgb1[1] - rgb2[1]
        v += d*d
        d = rgb1[2] - rgb2[2]
        v += d*d
        
        best = v if (v < best)
      end
      diff += best
    end
    diff
  end
  
  def slice_start_idx(s)
    @sw * s
  end
  
  def slice_end_idx(s)
    @sw * s + @sw - 1
  end
end

# calculate
img = Img.new

# create ALL pairings.
slices = 20
pairs = []
slices.times do |s1|
  slices.times do |s2|
    next if s1 == s2
    
    pairs.push [img.difference(img.slice_end_idx(s1), img.slice_start_idx(s2)), [s1, s2] ]
  end
end

def add_to_group(combined, new_group)
  # create array of fixed numbers
  taken_numbers = {}
  taken_left = {}
  taken_right = {}
  combined.each do |group|
    group[1..-2].each do |x|
      taken_numbers[x] = true
    end
    taken_left[group.last] = true
    taken_right[group.first] = true
  end
  
  was_found = false
  combined.each do |group|
    next if was_found
    if (group.last == new_group.first)    
      # insert at back
      was_found = true
      new_group.delete_at(0)
      if taken_numbers[new_group.last] || taken_left[new_group.last] || new_group.last == group.first
        return
      end
      new_group.each do |x|
        group.push x
      end
    elsif (group.first == new_group.last)
      # insert at front
      was_found = true
      new_group.pop
      if taken_numbers[new_group.first] || taken_right[new_group.first] || new_group.first == group.last
        return
      end
      new_group.reverse.each do |x|
        group.insert(0, x)
      end
    end
  end
  if !was_found    
    cf = combined.flatten
    new_group.each do |x|
      was_found = was_found || cf.index(x)
    end
    if !was_found
      combined.push new_group
    end
  end
end

# sort, lowest first
pairs.sort!

# create combinations.
# combined has an array of all correspondences.
combined = []
pairs.each do |diff, new_group|
  
  # insert new group
  add_to_group(combined, new_group)
  
  # try to recombine everything, until nothing changes any more
  was_recombined = true
  while was_recombined
    new_combined = []  
    combined.each do |group|
      add_to_group(new_combined, group)
    end
    was_recombined = combined.size != new_combined.size
    combined = new_combined
  end
  
  if (combined.size == 1 && combined[0].size == img.slices)
    # we got everything! Write output image.
    img.write(combined[0])
    exit
  end
end
```

## Result

Here is the result I got with this code:
![Tokyo Ordered](/img/2011/11/ordered.jpg)


## Algorithm

In hindsight, the algorithm combines two ideas: [Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering](http://nlp.stanford.edu/IR-book/html/htmledition/hierarchical-agglomerative-clustering-1.html), and a ~~quick and dirty~~ novel distance-metric that defines how "good" a pairing is.

The hierarchical agglomerative clustering is a bit difficult to code, because there are a lot of corner cases when you are allowed to combine pairings and when not. I am not sure if my code is correctly, this should be recoded without time pressure.

The first version of the distance metric was very simple: calculate the sum of the quadratic differences between the two neighboring pixels when two slices are put together. Unfortunately this does not work for the slices with skyscraper that has black-white stripes: here lots of pixels are white on the left side, but black on the right side since the building is just slightly tilt. After realizing this problem, the solution is simple: for each pixel, find the best matching pixel of the other slice within a certain range. Through trial and error I have chosen +-15 pixels, and finally got the correct image.


Happy hacking!
