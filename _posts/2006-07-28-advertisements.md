As you may have noticed, I have just added advertisements from google to my website. It will not get me rich but might cover the hosting costs.

I have tried to make the ads non-intrusive and seperate from content, so they just sit there on the right side. They are also adblock-friendly, so if you do not like ads and use an adblocker like [Adblock Plus](http://adblockplus.org/en/), you will never notice any page disortion whatsoever. On the other side, google seems to do  quite well at providing advertisements that is related to the article contents, so maybe the ads are even useful.

I hope everybody can live with that. Happy browsing!
