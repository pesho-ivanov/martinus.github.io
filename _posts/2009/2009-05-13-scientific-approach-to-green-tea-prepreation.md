A few months ago I seem to have become a green tea advocat, since I have realized that it is probably [the most healthy beverage ever invented](http://www.whfoods.com/genpage.php?tname=foodspice&dbid=146) (including water).

The enormous study "[Green Tea Consumption and Mortality Due to Cardiovascular Disease, Cancer, and All Causes in Japan](http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/abstract/296/10/1255)" took 11 years with over 40.000 participants, and got the following result:

## Green Tea Benefits in Woman
	
  * 23% lower risk of dying from any cause	
  * 31% lower risk of dying from CVD
  * 62% lower risk of dying from stroke

## Green Tea Benefits in Men
	
  * 12% lower risk of dying from any cause	
  * 22% lower risk of dying from CVD
  * 42% lower risk of dying from stroke

On my quest for the perfect cup of tea, I have looked for scientific analysis and have found the enlightening paper "[Factors Affecting the Caffeine and Polyphenol Contents of Black and Green Tea Infusions](http://drmuthumani.googlepages.com/Factorsaffecting.pdf)". Here are the most important findings of it:

How to get the most out of a tea bag. The more extracted solids / catechins, the better.

## Brewing
	
* doubling the bags doubles the extracted solids (which is good!)
* Increasing brewing time from 1 minute to 2 minutes doubles the catechins. 5 minutes tripple the catechins.

## Teabags vs. loose leafes
	
* Loose leafes are better than teabags.
* When teabags are left floating, the flow resistance of the material blocks almost everything! This is very bad.
* Continuously dunk a tea bag and the extraction is 4 times better!
* Loose leafes are still about 20% better than dunked teabags, and after about 2 minutes the water is saturated (no need to wait any further)

## Leafe size / packing

* loose leafes? extraction is faster with smaller leafes. No need for dunking.
* teabag with small leafes / tightly packed? Continuously dunk it
* teabag with large leafes / loosely packed? Leafe it static (the flows are driven by convection)

## Conclusion

* loose leafes are the best. Brew for 2 minutes and you have everything they got.
* If you have to use teabags, dunking the bag gets you 4 times the catechins!
