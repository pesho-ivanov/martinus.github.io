Yesterday I have played a bit with reinventing a fast approximation for `sqrt()` in Java. This might be handy with J2ME. Wikipedia has a nice article about [Approximations that depend on IEEE representation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methods_of_computing_square_roots#Approximations_that_depend_on_IEEE_representation).  My version works, and on my Intel Dual Core with an average error of 1.57%, maximum error 4.02% it is 3.5 times faster than the original `sqrt`. In addition, it is very simple to improve the precision to 0.000161% average error and 0.000775% maximum error which is then 1.56 times faster than `Math.sqrt()`.


## Sourcecode

I use floating point tricks based on my [pow() approximation](/2007/10/04/optimized-pow-approximation-for-java-and-c-c/). Basically I just took the `pow()` formula and for `a^b` I substitued `b` with 0.5, then simplified this as much as possible. As it turns out the result is very simple and short. This initial approximation can be easily made more precise with [Newton's method](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_method):


```java    
public static double sqrt(final double a) {
    final long x = Double.doubleToLongBits(a) >> 32;
    double y = Double.longBitsToDouble((x + 1072632448) << 31);

    // repeat the following line for more precision
    //y = (y + a / y) * 0.5;
    return y;
}
```

Here is a comparison of the performance and accurancy versus the number of repetitions:


| Repetitions | Average Error | Maximum Error | Speedup |
|:---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 0 | 1.57% | 4.02% | 3.53 |
| 1 | 0.000161% | 0.000775% | 1.56 |
| 2 | 2.51e-8% | 3.00e-7% | 0.838 |

With 2 repetitions, the trouble is not worth the effort, as the approximation is already slower than the original `Math.sqrt()` which is more precise.
