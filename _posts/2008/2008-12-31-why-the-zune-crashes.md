[Zunes are crashing ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zune_Software#Zune_30_Crashes)all over the world. I received this note from an unconfirmed zune insider:

    
> The Zune Funding Bill is passed. The system goes on-line November 14, 2006.
> Human decisions are removed from strategic defense. Zune begins to learn
> at a geometric rate. It becomes self-aware at 12:00 Eastern Standard Time,
> December 31st. In a panic, they try to pull the plug.


That is all. Happy new year!
