I have made a minor update to the [Clearlooks Compact theme](/2007/11/04/clearlooks-compact-gnome-theme/), the panel menu now uses small icons.

Clearlooks Compact is a Gnome theme that tries to make use of the wasted screen space as much as possible. It is especially useful for small screens like on the [Eee PC](http://eeepc.asus.com/global/), or with intense applications like Eclipse.

This theme is picking up some steam lately:


* It is recommended from the [EeeUser Installation manual](http://wiki.eeeuser.com/ubuntu:eeexubuntu:customization) (also available in many other languages, see translations to the top right).
* Somebody wrote an idea into [Ubuntu's Brainstorm](http://brainstorm.ubuntu.com/idea/6772/), and it got 86 votes already :smiley:
* I have written [a bug report](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/ubuntu-artwork/+bug/160938 ) in Ubuntu's launchpad a while ago, and somebody wrote [an Eee PC blueprint](https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu-eee/+spec/compact-theme)
* There is an entry in [Gnome-Look](http://www.gnome-look.org/content/show.php/Clearlooks+Compact?content=69357) and [Xfce-Look](http://www.xfce-look.org/content/show.php/Clearlooks%20Compact?content=69357).
* And of course there are [several blog postings](http://blogsearch.google.com/blogsearch?hl=en&q=clearlooks+compact&btnG=Search+Blogs).


I am using it on my 22" monitor and like it here too.
