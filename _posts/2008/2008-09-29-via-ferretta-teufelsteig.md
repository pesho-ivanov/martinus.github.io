This sunday I was on a fabulous via ferrata (german translation is "Klettersteig"). Here is a video of it:

The via feretta is called [Teufelsteig](http://www.bergsteigen.at/de/touren.aspx?ID=408) which translates to devli's steep road.

Walking through difficult terrain, close to the peak:

Finally, after about 4 hours hiking and climbing, we have reached the peak of 1822m and enjoy the view :)
